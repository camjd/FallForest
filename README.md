# FallForest
Project that has leaves fall and grows branches and subbranches.

### How does recursion allow small changes to ripple through the whole structure?
Using recursive methods like the ones for sub-branches affects the whole tree. When one branch changes (leaves fall or regrow), the same behavior applies throughout the rest of the tree.

### Where else in nature or daily life do you see recursive patterns?
Some of my favorite recursive patterns I see in nature are inside of flowers, on the patterns of animals, the waves of water, and human veins. There are so many recursive patterns in nature and they're really interesting!

### Explain how your code mirrors a natural process.
My code mirrors a natural process through the use of recursive methods and randomization that work to reflect the semi-fractal like occuring decay and then growth of leaves (smaller parts behaving like the whole).

### What did you learn about recursion from simulating something organic?
I learned how important recursion is for making things seem natural. When paired with randomization they start to appear even more natural. If I were to tweak it to make the recursion, randomization, and timing better it could appear even more organic.
